 # IoT Smart Home Automation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Python-based IoT system to control and monitor home devices with APIs and cloud integration.

## Features
- Control devices (e.g., lights, temperature sensors) using APIs.
- Monitor real-time data from simulated IoT sensors.
- Easy to extend with cloud integration for remote access.

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: Flask API for device communication.
- `scripts/`: Sensor simulation scripts.
- `cloud/`: (Future) Cloud integration for AWS IoT Core or Google Cloud IoT.
- `tests/`: Placeholder for unit tests.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravinalla1109/IoT-Smart-Home-Automation.git
